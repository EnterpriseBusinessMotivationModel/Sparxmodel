<font size="4"><span style="font-size:14pt"><b>Introduction </p>
</b></span></font></p>
<p><p>
When first approaching the Enterprise Business Motivation Model, it helps to </p>
<p>
start with the highest level objects and to see the model as a fairly simple </p>
<p>
construction.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
The EBMM is, first and foremost, a way to describe a complex organization </p>
<p>
that allows interesting insight to be gained. It is a tool, a competitive weapon, </p>
<p>
to be wielded by any business leader that is interested in moving his or her </p>
<p>
business from simply being <font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">&ldquo;good&rdquo; to being truly great.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
Understanding about a business does not emerge from a single method or </p>
<p>
approach. It emerges because the basic information about the business is so </p>
<p>
well organized that a hundred different methods can be applied, each to refine </p>
<p>
or improve the business in some key way. </p>
</p>
<p><p>
That can only happen if the information is well assembled, in a structure that is </p>
<p>
complete and scientifically created. The EBMM provides the structure for </p>
<p>
information about your business that allows a wide array of analysis and </p>
<p>
improvement methodologies, from process management to enterprise </p>
<p>
architecture, to provide rapid and valuable returns in your business.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
In most large enterprises, the information about a business takes many forms. </p>
<p>
Some context can be found in well reasoned strategy memos, while other </p>
<p>
details may be barely described at all, existing only in the traditions and </p>
<p>
memories of key employees.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
The information structure for describing a business must, therefore, cope with </p>
<p>
information that may exist in many forms, and different levels of detail. The </p>
<p>
EBMM provides this flexibility, because the various elements of a business can </p>
<p>
be described and refined <font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><i>independently</i>, producing interesting observations </p>
<p>
and ideas for enhancement, without the need for every detail to be captured </p>
<p>
first.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
The EBMM itself is not complex. Yet it is more complex than many of the </p>
<p>
models in use by business consultants. In developing this model, we took the </p>
<p>
advice of Einstein: <font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><i>Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.</i> </p>
<p>
That is precisely what the Enterprise Business Motivation Model is, and does. </p>
<p>
It is a simple model, but not too simple. Interesting and useful illustrations can </p>
<p>
be created specifically because of this rich balance between simplicity and </p>
<p>
completeness.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
The high level model is illustrated twice below: once in a graphic layout </p>
<p>
suitable for PowerPoint presentations, and the other in a technical layout </p>
<p>
suitable for business and enterprise architects. (Note that the technical </p>
<p>
illustration differentiates core elements by both color (pale green) and the </p>
<p>
thickness of the borders around each term). </p>

</b></span></font></p>
<p><p>
<br/>
</p>
</p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The core elements of the EBMM are listed below, along with an informal </p>
<p>
description of each one. (For more formal descriptions, see the detailed </p>
<p>
section dedicated to each of the areas).</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Influencer</b> &ndash; something outside the enterprise that has the potential for </p>
<p>
impacting, for better or worse, its business fortunes. These are not people. </p>
<p>
They are situations, like competitive pressures and regulations. Note: analysts </p>
<p>
are not influencers, but a <i>business trend</i> (potentially started by an influential </p>
<p>
person, like an analyst) can be.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Assessment</b> &ndash; A collection of judgments about the fundamental business </p>
<p>
model(s) of the enterprise. Strategic planning units (and Business </p>
<p>
Management consultants) frequently provide these assessments in order to </p>
<p>
help executives make informed and well-reasoned decisions. A business </p>
<p>
model assessment evaluates a business model, describes the impact of an </p>
<p>
influencer, and may provide the impetus for the creation of a driver.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Driver</b> &ndash; something inside the business that motivates people to make a </p>
<p>
change. This can include a person who shares a consistent opinion, but more </p>
<p>
frequently this would be things like strategies, objectives, and roadmaps. A </p>
<p>
driver responds to an influencer and either makes changes to the business </p>
<p>
model itself, or encourages a change in the business that supports the </p>
<p>
optimum performance of the existing business model.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Business Model</b> &ndash; a description of the way that an enterprise hopes to make </p>
<p>
money. Synonymous with a &ldquo;business plan,&rdquo; a business model represents and </p>
<p>
describes each of the elements needed for a business to provide a valuable </p>
<p>
product or service to a customer, through the application of resources, the </p>
<p>
engagement of partners, and the expenditure of capital.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Customer </b>- A person or organization to which the products and services of an </p>
<p>
organization are targeted.&#160; For profit-earning organizations, the customer is a </p>
<p>
source of revenue.&#160; For non-profit organizations and government entities, a </p>
<p>
customer is being offered services that are often subsidized through other </p>
<p>
revenue sources (like charitable contributions and taxes respectively).&#160; </p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Business Unit Capability</b> &ndash; A description of a <i>responsibility</i> of a business </p>
<p>
unit, as required by the business model. For example, if the accounting group </p>
<p>
is responsible for paying creditors, then we&rsquo;d describe a single business unit </p>
<p>
capability as such: &ldquo;the accounting business unit requires the capability to pay </p>
<p>
creditors.&rdquo; A business unit capability is implemented through one or more </p>
<p>
business processes and is described only in the context of a business unit.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Business Unit</b> &ndash; A group of people that employ tools, processes, and </p>
<p>
information to perform their responsibilities. Usually organized in a hierarchy </p>
<p>
(which means that one business unit can include a number of sub-units, and </p>
<p>
so on). Business units perform business processes.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Business Initiative &ndash; </b>An intentional effort chartered to make a change to the </p>
<p>
manner, approach, products, structure, and/or contractual relationships that </p>
<p>
make up the various functions of the business.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Business Process</b> &ndash; Informally, a business process is a description of the </p>
<p>
things that people (and sometimes machines) do in order to run the business. </p>
<p>
A process may include subprocesses, to many levels of depth, and the </p>
<p>
activities of a process are &ldquo;governed&rdquo; by directives.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Application &ndash;</b> One of the basic building blocks of Information Technology, an </p>
<p>
application is a software product or a combination of hardware and software, </p>
<p>
that addresses the needs of the business or its stakeholders.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Data Object</b> -- A key element in analyzing both business processes and </p>
<p>
business applications, a data object refers to any &quot;thing&quot; that the business </p>
<p>
manipulates that is represented in data.&#160; This is usually a business document </p>
<p>
(like an invoice or an order) but can refer to any kind of structured or </p>
<p>
unstructured information that is either the input to, output of, or used within a </p>
<p>
business process.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Directive</b> &ndash; The rules that people follow when performing business processes. </p>
<p>
This includes business policies (at a higher level) and business rules (at a </p>
<p>
more detailed level). </p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Note that the technical illustration above shows a couple of concepts that are </p>
<p>
not core concepts, but which relate directly to more than one core concept. </p>
<p>
This allows us to describe additional ways in which these core concepts are </p>
<p>
related. </p>
