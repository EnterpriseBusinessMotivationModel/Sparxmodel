<p><p>
The Enterprise Business Motivation Model was created to bring together a </p>
<p>
number of different sources of conceptual input. This section will describe the </p>
<p>
sources used to construct the EBMM.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
The first source is the internal Enterprise Architecture team within the Microsoft </p>
<p>
corporation. This provides a real-world view of business motivation, and the </p>
<p>
ideas introduced in the model are colored by the experience of using the </p>
<p>
model in a practical environment.&#160; </p>
</p>
<p><p>
While the Microsoft IT model is directly tied to practice, it is a compromise view </p>
<p>
of the current state of thinking at the time it was developed.&#160; As such, it is more </p>
<p>
complex than necessary and misses opportunities to integrate with wider </p>
<p>
research.&#160; On the positive side, this model provides a great deal of source </p>
<p>
material for business capability modeling, information modeling, program and </p>
<p>
project modeling, process improvement, and program governance.&#160; All of </p>
<p>
these issues are very well covered in this model and provide much of the </p>
<p>
foundation for thinking about business motivation context for the EBMM.</p>

<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The second source is the standards community, represented by the OMG and </p>
<p>
the Open Group&rsquo;s efforts in describing a business motivation model in their </p>
<p>
standards efforts.&#160; </p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Specifically, from the OMG comes the Business Motivation Model, a basic </p>
<p>
model that describes business motivation in terms of &quot;means,&quot; &quot;ends,&quot; </p>
<p>
&quot;influencers,&quot; and &quot;assessments.&quot;&#160; This high level view is further broken down </p>
<p>
into subject areas that define strategy, tactics, business rules, policies, goals, </p>
<p>
objectives, and types of influencers.&#160; </p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">There are a number of useful concepts missing from this view, which limit the </p>
<p>
value of the BMM in business architecture endeavors.&#160; </p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
a) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	There is no notion of the business itself being a composition of many </p>
<p>
sets of business models, each with their own means and ends.&#160; This </p>
<p>
limits the ability to discuss the possibility that two &quot;parts&quot; of the business </p>
<p>
may have competing goals, or to discuss the relative merits of </p>
<p>
performing a project to support one goal instead of another.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
b) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	There is no notion of a business unit or the organization of business </p>
<p>
units.&#160; This is important for grounding the business architecture efforts, </p>
<p>
as most of the concerns of business architects focus on resolving </p>
<p>
issues that span one or more business units.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
c) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Many of the key concerns of business architects focus on evaluating the </p>
<p>
readiness of specific business processes, tools, technologies, </p>
<p>
information, people, and governance structures in the light of these </p>
<p>
motivations.&#160; As a result, the model is fairly incomplete in that most of </p>
<p>
these concerns cannot be addressed with the model as it stood.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
As a result, while the BMM is useful for modeling the &quot;idea&quot; of a business, it </p>
<p>
turns out it is not useful for modeling the complex and diverse organizations </p>
<p>
that tend to employ business architects, or to meet the needs of these </p>
<p>
practicing architects in their fields.</p>

<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The contribution from the Open Group comes in the form of the metamodel </p>
<p>
developed and delivered in TOGAF (<i>&quot;The Open Group Architectural </p>
<p>
Framework&quot;</i>) version 9.0.&#160; The core metamodel, as defined in section 34.3.3 of </p>
<p>
TOGAF, provides some insight into the level of sophistication of the TOGAF at </p>
<p>
this stage of development. In that model, the business is not actually modeled </p>
<p>
except as a hierarchy of organizational units.&#160; </p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">This model fails in the basic requirements of Business Architecture to model </p>
<p>
the structural elements of the business itself, relying on the proxy of business </p>
<p>
unit to include those elements in their definition.&#160; As most businesses with </p>
<p>
more than 300 employees have a business architecture that does not </p>
<p>
consistently use business units as the building blocks of the architecture, this </p>
<p>
assumption produces a metamodel that cannot produce viable models of </p>
<p>
influence, structure, intent, information flow, interrelationships, and business </p>
<p>
rules.&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result, the TOGAF, while purporting to be an EA framework, fails </p>
<p>
to capture most of the key concerns of business architecture.</p>

<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">One strong influence comes from the work of Alexander Osterwalder, whose </p>
<p>
Ph.D. thesis described the concept of a business model as a specific </p>
<p>
composition of business elements.&#160; Dr. Osterwalder is a young management </p>
<p>
consultant in Europe and was not aware of the work of Enterprise Architecture </p>
<p>
or Business Architecture before writing his Ph.D. thesis on business models </p>
<p>
and a subsequent book on the topic.&#160; </p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">While the book, &quot;Business Model Generation&quot; is a highly accessible book, it </p>
<p>
also fails to deal with the fact that large organizations have multiple business </p>
<p>
models and that they do not nest neatly within one another.&#160; The resulting </p>
<p>
models are useful when analyzing a business model, but not useful for </p>
<p>
modeling an entire organization composed of many businesses.&#160; </p>
