<p><p>
This document describes the Enterprise Business Motivation Model (EBMM), a </p>
<p>
conceptual model of Enterprise Business Architecture.&#160; The EBMM was </p>
<p>
originally developed by Nick Malik, Enterprise Architect from Microsoft, with </p>
<p>
inputs and collaboration from dozens of architects, innovators, business </p>
<p>
leaders, and technology practitioners across a wide array of industries.&#160; The </p>
<p>
EBMM was first published in 2009 in an article in the Architecture Journal and </p>
<p>
was subsequently revised in the spring and summer of 2011.&#160; Subsequent </p>
<p>
revisions have taken place with other architects, notably including Mike Clark </p>
<p>
and Robert Singers.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
<font size="4"><span style="font-size:14pt"><b>Purpose of the Enterprise Business Motivation Model</p>
</b></span></font></p>
<p><p>
As of the first decade of the millennium, Business Architecture has become a </p>
<p>
profession in its own right, emerging from a wide array of business </p>
<p>
management practices including leadership, organizational design, and </p>
<p>
enterprise architecture.&#160; Early practices emerged out of consulting </p>
<p>
organizations, and were created in a proprietary context.&#160; Each of the </p>
<p>
practitioners worked for the same company, and shared both the language and </p>
<p>
culture of that company.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
The people who worked as Business Architecture consultants were fairly fluid, </p>
<p>
moving from one company to another and taking their practices and </p>
<p>
experiences with them.&#160; As a result, while the practices of Business </p>
<p>
Architecture have emerged from many companies, the practices themselves </p>
<p>
are quite similar in scope and intended effect.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
To the dismay of many practitioners of Business Architecture, each consulting </p>
<p>
firm uses a different language set when describing the terminology of business </p>
<p>
architecture.&#160; As a result, while the practices are quite similar, the profession </p>
<p>
itself has a difficult time maturing, as findings and conclusions developed in </p>
<p>
one company have to be painstakingly translated to the terminology of other </p>
<p>
organizations to be reused or improved upon.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
The goal of the Enterprise Business Motivation Model is nothing less than to </p>
<p>
be the Rosetta Stone for Business Architecture.&#160; By describing the common </p>
<p>
concerns of Business Architecture, and then illustrating how the terminology </p>
<p>
can be used to address those concerns, the EBMM attempts to form the </p>
<p>
foundation for shared communication and collaboration across the field.&#160; </p>
</p>
<p><p>
There are many potential benefits for creating and supporting a shared </p>
<p>
language for Business Architecture.&#160; Training can become consistent and </p>
<p>
aligned with other fields, practitioners can consume the artifacts produced by </p>
<p>
others more easily, and therefore deliver value more quickly to our </p>
<p>
stakeholders, and the credibility of the entire field can be improved as </p>
<p>
consistent leaders emerge, able to communicate with stakeholders in many </p>
<p>
organizations.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
<font size="4"><span style="font-size:14pt"><b>Scope of the Enterprise Business Motivation Model</p>
</b></span></font></p>
<p><p>
Creating a project to define the terms and terminology of Business Architecture </p>
<p>
is a mammoth undertaking.&#160; The field has emerged organically across a wide </p>
<p>
array of practitioners, each who brings their own terms and practices to the </p>
<p>
field.&#160; The scope of this effort must be carefully defined in order to prevent the </p>
<p>
effort from becoming bogged down in indirect-yet-related concerns.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
The scope of this effort will focus on the interrelationship of concepts, and the </p>
<p>
information that should be understood when a concept is used.&#160; In effect, the </p>
<p>
model helps practitioners to speak consistently about the structure and shape </p>
<p>
of an enterprise.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
Words by themselves are not interesting, and therefore not memorable.&#160; In </p>
<p>
order for the concepts of business architecture to be used consistently, we </p>
<p>
must tie those concepts to practices, methods, and artifacts that business </p>
<p>
architects follow and produce each and every day.&#160; Concepts cannot live </p>
<p>
independently of the processes and methods in which they are used, because </p>
<p>
these methods define the community of people who share the concepts.&#160; </p>
</p>
<p><p>
Therefore, the following elements are &quot;in-scope&quot; for the EBMM documentation </p>
<p>
that follows:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm; color= #010101;  ">
<p>A basic understanding of key concerns of business architecture, and a </p>
simple taxonomy of business roles that may share those concerns.&#160; This </p>
work helps to clarify the stakeholders for the EBMM and the concerns that </p>
they would like to see addressed through business architecture.</p>
</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm; color= #010101;  ">A reasonable set of &quot;viewpoints&quot; to approach the concerns of the </p>
stakeholders.&#160; A viewpoint, as described in ISO 42010, is a coherent </p>
intersection of stakeholder concerns.&#160; By understanding the viewpoints we </p>
seek to address, business architects can focus in on a subset of concepts </p>
needed to address them.&#160; For each viewpoint, a subset of the entire EBMM </p>
can be described and used.</p>
</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm; color= #010101;  ">A rationalized list of terms for the entire Enterprise Business Motivation </p>
Model.&#160; </p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following elements are &quot;out of scope&quot; for the EBMM documentation that </p>
<p>
follows:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm; color= #010101;  ">
<p>A complete description of the methods, processes, and tasks of business </p>
architecture.&#160; While this would be useful, and is a necessary part of </p>
creating a common base of performance for the field, it is simply too </p>
difficult for the people involved in creating this model to gain sufficient </p>
consensus to describe these methods in any authoritative manner.</p>
</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm; color= #010101;  ">A complete rationalization of terms pertaining to every other field that </p>
business architects may interact with.&#160; The terminology of Business </p>
Architecture has emerged from individual innovators, leveraging their own </p>
experience as well as their synthesis of the published works of innovative </p>
management thinkers, ranging from Peter Drucker to Rummler and Brache. </p>
These thinkers did not work together to create their world view, and the </p>
resulting synthesis that emerges in the work of Business Architecture is </p>
similarly &quot;free flowing&quot; with concepts and concerns that do not directly fall </p>
within the scope of BA.&#160; We are not going to attempt to get these business </p>
leaders, or their acolytes, to agree on terms and terminology.&#160; That would </p>
be unnecessary to meet our goals.</p>
</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1mm; margin-right: 0mm; padding-left: 0mm; color= #010101;  ">A technical data model useful for creating products.&#160; This conceptual model </p>
is not a technical data model.&#160; Many various data models can be derived </p>
from the full EBMM or from the viewpoint models.&#160; Those models can be </p>
used to create software products.&#160; While this is a very valuable endeavor, it </p>
is outside the scope of this effort.&#160; The license for the EBMM provides </p>
anyone who would like to view it the full rights to create such software </p>
components without royalties to any contributors to the model.&#160; This is </p>
effectively an open source effort.&#160; However, the value of creating a model </p>
for the sake of communication cannot be reached in a reasonable </p>
timeframe if we allow ourselves to become consumed with the necessary </p>
but tedious details of relational data modeling.&#160; We leave that level of </p>
analysis to others.</p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<font size="4"><span style="font-size:14pt"><b>Who is involved</p>
</b></span></font></p>
<p><p>
The effort of creating the EBMM will not be limited to people directly involved in </p>
<p>
business architecture.&#160; However, we will seek out contributions from business </p>
<p>
architects and enterprise architects as a first order activity and the </p>
<p>
contributions of actual practitioners will be viewed more highly and considered </p>
<p>
more readily than the contributions of interested individuals who do not </p>
<p>
participate in business architecture activities as part of their vocation.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
That said, there is no &quot;governing body&quot; for the EBMM at this time.&#160; There is not </p>
<p>
&quot;committee of peers&quot; that is actively formed and regularly meeting to discuss </p>
<p>
this effort.&#160; It emerges over time.&#160; As each potential contributor discovers the </p>
<p>
EBMM and submits BA-specific ideas for consideration, Nick Malik, the primary </p>
<p>
author of the EBMM, will take those considerations into account and either </p>
<p>
modify the model or provide a good justification for how the existing model can </p>
<p>
meet that expectation.&#160; As a result, there is no end date for &quot;completing&quot; the </p>
<p>
model.&#160; We should all expect it to gradually emerge over the span of many </p>
<p>
years.</p>
</p>
<p><p>
If, over time, a governing body emerges that would like to collaborate to </p>
<p>
develop and refine the model, the above will change.&#160; </p>
